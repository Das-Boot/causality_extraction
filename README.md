## Highlights
- A novel causality tagging scheme has been proposed to serve the causality extraction
- Transferred embeddings dramatically alleviate the problem of data insuï¬ƒciency
- The self-attention mechanism can capture long-range dependencies between causalities
- Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other baselines
