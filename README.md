**S**elf-Attentive BiLSTM-**C**RF w**I**th with **T**ransferred **E**mbeddings for Causality Extraction.
- arXiv paper link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07629.pdf
- All code will be released upon publication

## Highlights
- A novel causality tagging scheme has been proposed to serve the causality extraction
- Transferred embeddings dramatically alleviate the problem of data insuï¬ƒciency
- The self-attention mechanism can capture long-range dependencies between causalities
- Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other baselines
